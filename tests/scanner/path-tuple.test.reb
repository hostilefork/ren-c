; Each test starts with a string to transcode, then `->`, and then the one or
; more transformed representations of what the string is expected to load as.
;
; Testing in this fashion is important beyond just checking structural
; ambiguities.  Simpler tests like ["/a" -> /a] could just mirror the error,
; e.g. by loading the test incorrectly as ["/a" -> / a] and then validating
; against its own bad load.
