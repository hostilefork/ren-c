; GET-GROUP!s will splice rules, null means no rule but succeeds...FALSE is
; useful for failing, and TRUE is a synonym for NULL in this context.
;
; They act like a COMPOSE that runs each time the GET-GROUP! is passed.

("aaa" == parse "aaa" [:(if false ["bbb"]) "aaa"])
("aaa" == parse "bbbaaa" [:(if true ["bbb"]) "aaa"])

("b" == parse "aaabbb" [:([some "a"]) :([some "b"])])
("b" == parse "aaabbb" [:([some "a"]) :(if false [some "c"]) :([some "b"])])

; !!! Partial rule splicing doesn't work with GET-GROUP! being a combinator
; under the constraints of the current design...this would mean it would be
; effectively a "variadic combinator", or would be sending some signal up
; to the BLOCK! combinator about what it wanted to splice.  Punt on it for now,
; as being able to redefine the behavior of GET-GROUP! via a combinator is
; much more compelling.
