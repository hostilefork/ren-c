; <any> takes the place of R3-Alpha SKIP in UPARSE.  The ANY operation has been
; replaced by OPT SOME or MAYBE SOME with the optional use of FURTHER, which
; lets "any" mean its more natural non-iterative sense.
;
; This addresses the fact that `x: skip` seems fishy...if something is
; being "skipped over" then why would it yield a value?
