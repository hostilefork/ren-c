; %parse-collect.test.reb
;
; COLLECT is implemented on top of a generic facility for storing "pending"
; results.  This gives the impression of "rollback"--though what is actually
; happening is that combinators are bubbling up a list of items that can be
; filtered by other combinators to extract data from.
;
; Most combinators allow the bubbling up to happen automatically--where every
; successful parser they call will contribute its results to the growing array
; in the order the parsers were called.  This is not good enough for some
; combinators (like BLOCK!) which have higher-level concepts than the mere
; success of individual parsers to decide what is kept.  (e.g. a parser must
; be part of an entire successful *alternate group* of parsers to have its
; "pendings" contribute to the result).
