; %file-port.test.reb
;
; There was basically no testing of the R3-Alpha file port, and so in
; addition to its various nebulous semantics, it was extremely buggy.
; As a first attack to improve matters, Ren-C is putting aside most of
; the semantic questions just to get what was somewhat defined to be
; working robustly.  This is helped by being able to build on top of
; a single API cross-platform: libuv.

; directory, make some simple small files and then delete them just to
