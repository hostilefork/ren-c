; The original COLLECT didn't have any tests in the Saphirion collection.
; It actually is tested pretty well by virtue of being used a lot, but the
; subtlety of the return value of KEEP (not used that often) as well as the
; behavior of COLLECT* is something that wasn't getting validated.


; COLLECT* is the lower-level operation that returns NULL if it opts out of
; collecting with nulls or has no collects.  Empty blocks count as asking
; to collect emptiness.
