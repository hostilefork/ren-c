; Typically SET and GET evaluate GROUP!s in paths, vs. treat them "as-is".
; But various circumstances like using GROUP! as map keys warrant it.  This
; can be done via POKE or with the BLOCK! form of SET and GET.
;
; The block form is also used to avoid double-evaluations in things like
; DEFAULT.  The groups are evaluated and captured as a block of steps in the
; GET pass, and that block of inert elements is reused on the SET pass.
