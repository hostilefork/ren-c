; nihils don't vanish in ordinary EVAL operations (just special constructs which
; choose to interpret them as vanishing).  But they are invalid as parameters
; to things like EQUAL?, so meta operations (or functions taking meta args)
; are the only way to test for and process them.

; Actual vanishing stuff via nihil (empty packs) can only be observed via
; meta operations.
