; The FRAME! type is foundational to the mechanics of Ren-C vs. historical
; Rebol.  While its underlying storage is similar to an OBJECT!, it has a
; more complex mechanic based on being able to be seen through the lens of
; multiple different "views" based on which phase of a function composition
; it has been captured for.


; Due to some fundamental changes to how parameter lists work, such that
; each action doesn't get its own copy, some tests of parameter hiding no
; longer work.  They were moved into this issue for consideration:
;
; https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/issues/393#issuecomment-745730620

; An "original" FRAME! that is created is considered to be phaseless.  When
; you execute that frame, the function will destructively use it as the
; memory backing the invocation.  This means it will treat the argument cells
; as if they were locals, manipulating them in such a way that the frame
; cannot meaningfully be used again.  The system flags such frames so that
; you don't accidentally try to reuse them or assume their arguments can
; act as caches of the input.
