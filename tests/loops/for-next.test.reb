; REPEAT in Rebol2 with an ANY-SERIES? argument acted like a FOR-EACH on that
; series.  This is redundant with FOR-EACH.
;
; R3-Alpha changed the semantics to be like a FOR-NEXT (e.g. FORALL) where you
; could specify the loop variable instead of insisting your loop variable be
; the data you are iterating.
;
; Red forbids ANY-SERIES? as the argument of what to iterate over.
