; Historical Rebol unified bitwise not with "set complement" operations.
;
; But the idea of folding together the set operations with bitwise operations
; runs into trouble when you have something that can be treated with both
; methods: e.g. a BLOB!.  If the "intersection" of #{0102} and #{0203} is
; to be #{02}, then that must be distinct from bitwise AND.  This leads all
; the set-based operations to separate from the bitswise ones.
