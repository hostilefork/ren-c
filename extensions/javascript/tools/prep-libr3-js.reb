        The WASM files produced by Emscripten produce JavaScript functions
        that expect their arguments to be in terms of the SharedArrayBuffer
        HEAP32 that the C code can see.  For common JavaScript types, the
        `cwrap` helper can do most of the work:

        https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/Interacting-with-code.html

        However, libRebol makes extensive use of variadic functions, which
        means it needs do custom wrapping code.  Once it used a reverse
        engineered form of `va_list` (which is beyond the C standard, and each
        compiler could implement it differently).  But now it does it with
        an ordinary packed array of C pointers.
    }--

; Note: There are no `import` statements here because this is run by EVAL LOAD
; within the %make-librebol.r script's context.  This is done in order to
; inherit the `api` object, and the `for-each-api` enumerator.  As a result
; it also inherits access to CWRAP and other tools.  Review.

=== "ASYNCIFY_BLACKLIST TOLERANT CWRAP" ===

; !!! This is a clone of code you would get if you said:
;
;    emcc ... -s "DEFAULT_LIBRARY_FUNCS_TO_INCLUDE=['ccall', 'cwrap']" ...
;
; The reason it was cloned long ago was that  Emscripten's `cwrap` was based on
; a version of ccall which did not allow synchronous function calls in the
; while emscripten_sleep() is in effect.  This is an overly conservative assert
; when the function is on the blacklist and known to not yield:
;
; https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/9412
;
; So the code was copied from %preamble.js...minus that assert:
;
; https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/incoming/src/preamble.js
;
; Years later, Ren-C runs "stacklessly" and can suspend itself--meaning it
; no longer needs Asyncify to do yields.  But while the Ren-C core is able
; to do its own yields, it may become interesting to compile in library code
; from other sources that does not have that ability.  So code that was put
; together to make the Asyncify approach work is not being thrown out in a
; kneejerk fashion...in case it someday becomes useful.
;
; Note: In actuality, there's no preprocessor on this file as on preamble.js
; so this has to either keep or drop *all* of the code under `#if` directives,
; (-or- we'd have to do some preprocessing equivalent based on the build
; settings in the config we are doing `make prep` for.)
;
; !!! There may be few enough routines involved that the better answer is to
; dodge `cwrap`/`ccall` altogether and just by-hand wrap the routines.

=== "GENERATE ASYNCIFY BLACKLIST FILE" ===

; Asyncify has some automatic ability to determine what functions cannot be
; on the stack when a function may yield.  It then does not instrument these
; functions with the additional code allowing it to yield.  However, it makes
; a conservative guess...so it can be helped with additional blacklisted
; functions that one has knowledge should *not* be asyncified:
;
; https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/asyncify.html#optimizing
;
; While the list expected by Emscripten is JSON, that doesn't support comments
; so we transform it from Rebol.
;
; <review> ; IN LIGHT OF ASYNCIFY
; Beyond speed, an API marked in the blacklist has the special ability of
; still being run while in the yielding state (a feature added to Emscripten
; due to a Ren-C request):
;
; https://stackoverflow.com/q/51204703/
;
; This means that APIs which are able to be blacklisted can be called directly
; from within a JS-AWAITER.  That means being able to produce `reb.Text()`
; and other values.  But also critically can include reb.Promise() so that
; the final return value of a JS-AWAITER can be returned with it.

=== "GENERATE %NODE-PRELOAD.JS" ===

; !!! Node.js support lapsed for a time, due to no pthreads support:
;
; https://groups.google.com/d/msg/emscripten-discuss/NxpEjP0XYiA/xLPiXEaTBQAJ
;
; When it did work, it required code to be run in the `--pre-js` section.
;
; https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/4240
;
; However, much has changed (e.g. the emterpreter no longer is used due to
; asyncify).  This code is non-working, and needs review.
