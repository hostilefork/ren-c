; Startup calls the evaluator (that needs to yield in a general sense), but it
; does so before the JavaScript extension has had a chance to load.  And that
; extension contains the natives that call emscripten_sleep().
;
; On the downside, this means it can't be debugged except with `printf()`
; during boot.  On the upside, it means that there is no way it can need to
; yield...so it can run at full speed in WASM with no asyncify instrumentation.
;
; By a similar token, Shutdown happens after the JS extension is unloaded
; and also cannot experience yields.

; It seems that panicking is believed to potentially cause a yield, this should
