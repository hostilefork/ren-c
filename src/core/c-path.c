// back" the cell in the stored location to reflect the updated state.  This
// update can be a complete overwrite of the value, or it can be a "tweak"
// e.g. to ask to update the PROTECTED bits of a cell.
//
// To give an example: if you're asking to poke, that is translated into a
// TWEAK request.  If TWEAK's result isn't null here, that means there was
// a modification which nothing is writing back.  It would be like saying:
//
//     >> poke 12-Dec-2012 'year 1999
//     == 12-Dec-1999
//
// Because the return value is not null, it's telling you that if a tuple

// in obj.date would have to be changed.

// ACTION!s are used as a currency to help with situations like in the FFI:
//
//    struct.million_ints_field.10

// TWEAK* is called on each path step.  But if the underlying C data for the

// that into a BLOCK! of a million INTEGER!s... to then only pick the 10th!

// Hence, being able to return an ACTION! to be a "lazy" result that can
// narrowly do the 10th pick is useful.  But this must be distinguishable
// from a PICK that actually returns an ACTION! as the value (e.g. if an
// OBJECT! had an ACTION! as a field).  Hence, TWEAK* uses the dual protocol.
