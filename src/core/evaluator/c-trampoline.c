//
// This is the main loop of the interpreter.  We call this a "trampoline", in
// the spirit of the word as used in Lisp implementations.  That's because
// sub-expressions aren't evaluated with direct recursions of a C evaluator
// function, but using C's `return` to "bounce back" to a single loop,
// which invokes returned continuations.  Hence, there are no nested function
// calls and the C machine stack won't grow just because Ren-C stacks grow:
//
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)#High-level_programming
//
// !!! The ideal goal is that the Trampoline is never found recursively on a
// standard evaluation stack.  The only way it should be found on the stack
// more than once would be to call out to non-Rebol code, which then turned
// around and made an API call back in (it would not be able to gracefully
// unwind across such C stack frames).  In the interim, not all natives have
// been rewritten as state machines--it's a work-in-progress.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// 1. The instigating call to the Trampoline cannot be unwound across, as it
//    represents a "stackful" invocation of the evaluator.  Functions like
//    YIELD must know the passed-in frame is uncrossable, so that it can raise
//    an error if you try to unwind across a top-level Trampoline call.
//
//    !!! Instead of returning just `bool`, the Trampoline could theoretically
//    offer the option of returning a frame stack to the caller that it could
//    wrap up in a Promise.  This would be an alternative to raising errors.
//
// 2. In theory, a Trampoline caller could push several frames to be evaluated,
//    and the passed in `root` would just be where evaluation should *stop*.
//    No cases of this exist yet, so asserting you only pass in the topmost
//    frame is conservative for now.
//
// 3. A fail() can happen at any moment--even due to something like a failed
//    memory allocation requested by an executor itself.  These are called
//    "abrupt failures" (see FRAME_FLAG_ABRUPT_FAILURE).  The executor which
//    was active when that failure occurred is offered a chance to clean up.
//    But any stacks that it pushed which were not running will be discarded.
//
// 4. When fails occur, any frames which have been pushed that the trampoline
//    is not running currently will be above FRAME.  These are not offered the
//    chance to handle or trap the error.
//
//    (Example: When something like ALL is "between steps", the frame it
//     pushed to process its block will be above it on the stack.  If the ALL
//     decides to call fail(), the non-running stack frame can be "TOP_FRAME"
//     above the ALL's "FRAME".)

  // legacy/embedded platforms, but structured exception handling has support
  // on other systems like some WebAssembly--where longjmp may not be.
  //
  // Regardless of which implementation you are using, once an "exception" has
  // occurred you must jump up above the block to re-enable the "catching".
  // C++ does not allow a `goto` from outside of `try` block into it:
  //
  //    "A goto or switch statement shall not be used to transfer control
  //     into a try block or into a handler. "
  //
  // In the case of a C setjmp()/longjmp(), we have "used up" the jump buffer
  // after a longjmp() occurs, so obviously it needs to be re-setjmp'd.
  //
  // So either way, we can only jump to `bounce_on_trampoline` if no abrupt
  // fail() has occurred.  otherwise jump to `bounce_on_trampoline_with_trap`
  // to put the trapping back into effect.

    // 1. Having handling of UNWIND be in the trampoline means that any frame
    //    can be "teleported to" with a result, not just ACTION! frames.  It
    //    has a notable use by RETURN from a FUNC, which considers its type
    //    checking to be finished so it can skip past the Action_Executor().
    //
    //    !!! Using BOUNCE_THROWN makes it possible for UNWIND to be offered to
    //    dispatchers that catch throws.  This is used for instance in MACRO,
    //    which intercepts the UNWIND issued by RETURN, because it doesn't want
    //    to actually return the block (it wants to splice it).  But that may
    //    suggest MACRO wants to use its own throw type in a definitional
    //    return, so that you could generically UNWIND to a macro frame and
    //    overwrite the result verbatim.
    //
    // 2. Note FRAME->varlist may be SERIES_FLAG_INACCESSIBLE here.  This can
    //    happen with RETURN during ENCLOSE.  So don't use CTX(FRAME->varlist)
    //    here, as that would try to validate it as not being inaccessible.
    //
    // 3. Constructs like REDUCE-EACH keep a subframe pushed to do evaluation,
    //    but then want to keep that state while doing another evaluation
    //    (e.g. the body block).  To "punch a hole" through the evaluation
    //    frame it sets the executor to Just_Use_Out and can get the result
    //    without dropping the frame.  But thrown values like CONTINUE lead
    //    to a problem of how to express wanting TRAMPOLINE_KEEPALIVE to be
    //    applicable to throw situations as well--not all want it.  For now
