// Cell is the struct underlying all Rebol values.  It's designed to be four C
// pointers in size (so 16 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 32 bytes on 64-bit
// platforms).  Operation will be most efficient with those sizes, and there
// are checks on boot to ensure that `sizeof(Cell)` is the correct value for
// the platform.  But mechanically, the system should be *able* to work even
// if the size is bigger.
//
// Of the four 32-or-64-bit slots that each value has, the first slot is used
// for the value's "Header".  Those four bytes are:
//
// * BASE_BYTE: the first byte is a set of flags specially chosen to not
//   collide with the leading byte of a valid UTF-8 sequence.  The flags
//   establish whether this is a Cell or a "Stub", among other features.
//   See %struct-base.h for explanations of these flags.
//
// * KIND_BYTE: the second byte indicates what type of information the other
//   3 slots in the cell describe.  It corresponds to a datatype, such as
//   TYPE_INTEGER, TYPE_BLOCK, TYPE_TEXT, tec.
//
// * LIFT_BYTE: the third byte indicates how quoted something is, or if it
//   is a quaisform or antiform.  See %sys-quoted.h for more on how the byte
//   is interpreted.
//
// * The fourth byte contains other cell flags.  Some of them apply to any
//   cell type (such as whether the cell should have a new-line after it when
//   molded out during display of its containing array), and others have a
//   different purpose depending on what the KIND_BYTE is.
//
// As for the other 3 slots...obviously, an arbitrary long string won't fit
// into the remaining 3*32 bits, or even 3*64 bits!  You can fit the data for
// an INTEGER! or DECIMAL! in that (at least until they become arbitrary
// precision) but it's not enough for a generic BLOCK!, FRAME!, TEXT!, etc.
// So these slots are often used to point to one or more Rebol "stubs" (see
// %sys-stub.h for an explanation of stubs, which are the base class of
// things like Flex*, Array*, VarList*, and Map*.)
//
// So the next part of the structure is the "Extra".  This is the size of one
// pointer, which sits immediately after the header (that's also the size of
// one pointer).  For built-in types this can carry instance data for the
// cell--such as a binding, or extra bits for a fixed-point decimal.
//
// This sets things up for the "Payload"--which is the size of two pointers.
// It is broken into a separate structure at this position so that on 32-bit
// platforms, it can be aligned on a 64-bit boundary (assuming the cell's
// starting pointer was aligned on a 64-bit boundary to start with).  This is
// important for 64-bit value processing on 32-bit platforms, which will
// either be slow or crash if reads of 64-bit floating points/etc. are done
// on unaligned locations.

//
// See the defininitions of BASE_FLAG_XXX for the design points explaining
// why the first byte of cells and stubs are engineered with these specific
// common flags.
//
// The use of BASE_FLAG_MARKED in cells is a little unusual, because it is a
// property of the cell location and not of the value (e.g. it is not included
// in CELL_MASK_COPY, and is part of CELL_MASK_PERSIST).  So writing a new
// value into the cell will not update the status of its mark.  It must be
// manually turned off once turned on, or the cell must be reformatted entirely
// with Erase_Cell().
//
// **IMPORTANT**: This means that a routine being passed an arbitrary value
//   should not make assumptions about the marked bit.  It should only be
//   used in circumstances where some understanding of being "in control"
//   of the bit are in place--like processing an array a routine itself made.
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * VAR_MARKED_HIDDEN -- This uses the BASE_FLAG_MARKED bit on args in
//   action frames, and in particular specialization uses it to denote which
//   arguments in a frame are actually specialized.  This helps notice the
//   difference during an APPLY of encoded partial refinement specialization
//   encoding from just a user putting random values in a refinement slot.
//
// * PARAMSPEC_SPOKEN_FOR -- When parameters are optimizing the blocks they
//   receive, this is applied to any elements whose information was subsumed
//   into parameter flags or optimization bytes.  If the parameter could not
//   be fully optimized and needs to process the array, then anything with
//   this mark on it can be skipped.

//
// The "Heart" is the fundamental datatype of a Cell, dictating its payload
// layout and interpretation.  It's 64 fundamental types taking up 6 bits,
// and then an extra 2 bits ("crumb") that that encode whether one of 3
// different Sigil [@ ^ $] are present.
//
// Heart and Sigil are multiplexed into a single byte, called KIND_BYTE.
//
// Most of the time code wants to check the Type_Of() of a cell and not it's
// Heart_Of(), as Type treats quoted/quasi/antiform cells differently.  If you
// only check Heart, then (''''x) equals (x) because both hearts are WORD!.
//
// 1. It's good to document where a Byte means a KindByte.  This doesn't
//    come up too often because most code isn't set up to handle the
//    multiplexing of the Heart byte with a Sigil, so most code should just
//    be dealing with Heart or Option(Heart).
//
// 2. There's a complex runtime check to ensure coherence in the KIND_BYTE
//    with the rest of the cell, which is triggered in some C++ builds when
//    you use KIND_BYTE() directly.  This raw accessor is used to implement
//    that layer, and can also be used for efficiency in some cases that
//    want to subvert those checks.

//
// A Cell's underlying "HEART" can report it as something like TYPE_WORD, but
// that is only reported as the result of Type_Of() when LIFT_BYTE() is 2.
// When LIFT_BYTE() is 3 it says it is TYPE_QUASIFORM, and when it's greater
// than 4 then Type_Of() reports TYPE_QUOTED.  A LIFT_BYTE() of 1 will give
// back various TYPE_XXX answers corresponding to the antiforms (such as
// TYPE_SPLICE, TYPE_TRASH, TYPE_ERROR, etc.)

// This is a grab bag of all the different types that can be put in Cell and
// Stub slots that are the size of a platform pointer.  It's what is used for
// generic data representation in Stub.link, Stub.misc, Stub.info, Cell.extra,
// Cell.payload.split.one, and Cell.payload.split.two.
//
// The idea is that extensions that want to have their own custom Stub or
// Cell types would be able to define those custom types without needing to
// rebuild the core, since there's enough data types here and they can
// indicate whether they need GC marking with STUB_FLAG_LINK_NEEDS_MARK
// and CELL_FLAG_DONT_MARK_PAYLOAD_1, etc.  But for built-in Cells and Stubs it's
// okay to add fields here just for the sake of clarity...though all Base
// subclasses have to be assigned to just base. [1]
//
// 1. The garbage collector is designed to generically mark `Base*` entities
//    living in Cell and Stub slots.  To do this generic marking, no matter
//    what Base subclass was used, the same ->base field in a Union has to be
//    assigned in all cases...because if differently typed or different named
//    fields were assigned, then C++ compilers are not obligated to allow
//    access through some kind of canon "type pun":
//
//      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_punning#Use_of_union
//
//    This means generic slots that want to have nodes marked by the GC have
//    to use the ->node field of this union...regardless of what Base subtype
//    (Stub, Cell, VarList, Array, String, etc.) they refer to.
//

// Each value cell has a header, "extra", and payload.  Having the header come
// first is taken advantage of by the byte-order-sensitive macros to be
// differentiated from UTF-8 strings, etc. (See: Detect_Rebol_Pointer())
//
// Conceptually speaking, one might think of the "extra" as being part of
// the payload.  But it is broken out into a separate field.  This is because
// the `binding` property is written using common routines for several
// different types.  If the common routine picked just one of the payload
// forms initialize, it would "disengage" the other forms.
//
// (C permits *reading* of common leading elements from another union member,
// even if that wasn't the last union used to write it.  But all bets are off
// for other unions if you *write* a leading member through another one.
// For longwinded details: http://stackoverflow.com/a/11996970/211160 )
//
// Another aspect of breaking out the "extra" is so that on 32-bit platforms,
// the starting address of the payload is on a 64-bit alignment boundary.
// See IntegerPayload + DecimalPayload for examples where the 64-bit quantity
// requires things like REBDEC to have 64-bit alignment.  At time of writing,
// this is necessary for the "C-to-Javascript" emscripten build to work.
// It's also likely preferred by x86.

//=//// CELL's `PAYLOAD` FIELD DEFINITION /////////////////////////////////=//
//
// The payload is located in the second half of the cell.  Since it consists
// of four platform pointers, the payload should be aligned on a 64-bit
// boundary even on 32-bit platorms.
//
// `Custom` and `Bytes` provide a generic strategy for adding payloads
// after-the-fact.  This means clients (like extensions) don't have to have
// their payload declarations cluttering this file.
//
// IMPORTANT: `Bytes` should *not* be cast to an arbitrary pointer!!!  That
// would violate strict aliasing.  Only direct payload types should be used:
//
//     https://stackoverflow.com/q/41298619/
//


// COMMA! doesn't use its payload (or extra) for anything.

//=//// COMPLETED 4-PLATFORM POINTER CELL DEFINITION //////////////////////=//
//
// 1. Regardless of what build is made, the %rebol.h file expects to find the
//    name `struct RebolValueStruct` exported as what the API uses.  In the
//    C build that's the only cell struct, but in the C++ build it can be a
//    derived structure if CHECK_CELL_SUBCLASSES is enabled.
//
// 2. The DEBUG_TRACK_EXTEND_CELLS option doubles the cell size, but is a
//    *very* helpful debug option.  See %sys-track.h for explanation.
//
// 3. The C++ build disables copying and direct assignment of cells, such as:
//
//       Cell dest = *src;  // illegal!
//       *cell1 = *cell2;  // illegal!
//
//    The reason this is done is because not all flags from the source should
//    be copied (see CELL_MASK_COPY) and some flags in the destination must
//    be preserved (see CELL_MASK_PERSIST).  Copy mechanics are handled with
//    C functions (Copy_Cell(), Derelativize()) so really all the C++ build is
//    doing here is helping notice if you try to use a raw byte copy.
//
// 4. In cases where you do want to copy a Cell (or structure containing a
//    Cell) in a bytewise fashion, the copy disablement in [2] throws a wrench
//    into things.  Some compilers will disable memcpy() and memset() under
//    the assumption that those should count as "copying and assignment".
//    This is defeated by casting the destination address to a char* (void*
//    seems to have strict aliasing issues).  So Mem_Copy() and Mem_Fill()
//    are macros that do that:

//=//// CELL SUBCLASSES FOR QUARANTINING STABLE/UNSTABLE ANTIFORMS ////////=//
//
// Systemically, we want to stop antiforms from being put into the array
// elements of blocks, groups, paths, and tuples.  We also want to prevent
// unstable antiforms from being the values of variables.  To make it easier
// to do this, the C++ build offers the ability to make `Element` that
// can't hold any antiforms, `Value` that can hold stable antiforms, and
// `Atom` that can hold anything--including unstable isotopes.
//
// * Class Hierarchy: Atom as base, Value derived, Element derived
//   (upside-down for compile-time error preferences--we want passing an
//   Atom to a routine that expects only Element to not compile)
//
// * Primary Goal: Prevent passing Atoms/Values to Element-only routines,
//   or Atoms to Value-only routines.
//
// * Secondary Goal: Prevent things like passing Element cells to writing
//   routines that may potentially produce antiforms in that cell.
//
// * Tertiary Goal: Detect things like superfluous Is_Antiform() calls
//   being made on Elements.
//
// The primary goal is achieved by choosing Element as a most-derived type
// instead of a base type.  The next two goals are trickier, and require a
// smart pointer class to wrap the pointers and invert the class hierarchy
// in terms of what are accepted for initialization (see Sink() and Need()).
//
// Additionally, the Cell* class is differentiated by not allowing you to
// ask for its "type".  This makes it useful in passing to routines that
// are supposed to act agnostically regarding the quoting level of the cell,
// such as molding...where the quoting level is accounted for by the core
// molding process, and mold callbacks are only supposed to account for the
// cell payloads.

//=//// SLOTS /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// Contexts like OBJECT!, MODULE!, FRAME!, LET!, etc. store "variables".  A
// Cell that holds a variable's value is called a "Slot".  Slots have special
// considerations for handling, because they may store bit patterns that
// indicate a function should be run to fulfill the variable (a "GETTER") or
// a function should be run to accept a value to store (a "SETTER").
// These considerations apply when the Slot's LIFT_BYTE() is DUAL_0.
//
// This means you can't casually use something like Init_Integer() or
// Copy_Cell() to blindly write bit patterns into a Slot, because it might
// overlook handling of the special cases.  And you can't use functions like
// Type_Of() to read a Slot, either.  This means Slots have to go through
// special functions that in the general case, may run arbitrary code in
// the evaluator.
//
// There is one exception: an Init(Slot) e.g. what you get from adding a
// fresh variable to a context, is able to be initialized by any routine
// that could do an Init(Atom/Value/Element).
