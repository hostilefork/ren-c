// `struct Raw_Series` (or "REBSER") is a small-ish fixed-size descriptor for
// series data.  Usually it contains a pointer to a larger allocation for the
// actual contents.  But if the series is small enough, the contents are
// embedded into the REBSER structure itself.
//
// Every string, block, path, etc. in Rebol has a REBSER.  Since Rebol does
// not depend on any data structure libraries--like C++'s std::vector--this
// means that the REBSER is also used internally when there is a need for a
// dynamically growable contiguous memory structure.
//
// REBSER behaves something like a "double-ended queue".  It can reserve
// capacity at both the tail and the head.  When data is taken from the head,
// it will retain that capacity...reusing it on later insertions at the head.
//
// The space at the head is called the "bias", and to save on pointer math
// per-access, the stored data pointer is actually adjusted to include the
// bias.  This biasing is backed out upon insertions at the head, and also
// must be subtracted completely to free the pointer using the address
// originally given by the allocator.
//
// The REBSER is fixed-size, and is allocated as a "node" from a memory pool.
// That pool quickly grants and releases memory ranges that are sizeof(REBSER)
// without needing to use malloc() and free() for each individual allocation.
// These nodes can also be enumerated in the pool without needing the series
// to be tracked via a linked list or other structure.  The garbage collector
// is one example of code that performs such an enumeration.
//
// A REBSER node pointer will remain valid as long as outstanding references
// to the series exist in values visible to the GC.  On the other hand, the
// series's data pointer may be freed and reallocated to respond to the needs
// of resizing.  (In the future, it may be reallocated just as an idle task
// by the GC to reclaim or optimize space.)
//
//    *** THIS MEANS POINTERS INTO THE SER_DATA() FOR A MANAGED SERIES
//    MUST NOT BE HELD ONTO ACROSS EVALUATIONS, WITHOUT SPECIAL PROTECTION
//    OR ACCOMMODATION.**
//
// REBSERs may be either manually memory managed or delegated to the garbage
// collector.  Free_Unmanaged_Series() may only be called on manual series.
// See Manage_Series()/PUSH_GC_GUARD() for remarks on how to work safely
// with pointers to garbage-collected series, to avoid having them be GC'd
// out from under the code while working with them.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * For the forward declarations of series subclasses, see %reb-defs.h
//
// * Because a series contains a union member that embeds a REBVAL directly,
//   `struct Reb_Value` must be fully defined before this file can compile.
//   Hence %sys-rebval.h must already be included.
//
// * For the API of operations available on REBSER types, see %sys-series.h
//
// * Array(*) is a series that contains Rebol values (REBVALs).  It has many
//   concerns specific to special treatment and handling, in interaction with
//   the garbage collector as well as handling "relative vs specific" values.
//
// * Several related types (REBACT for function, Context(*) for context) are
//   actually stylized arrays.  They are laid out with special values in their
//   content (e.g. at the [0] index), or by links to other series in their
//   `->misc` field of the REBSER node.  Hence series are the basic building
//   blocks of nearly all variable-size structures in the system.
//
// * The element size in a REBSER is known as the "width".  R3-Alpha used a
//   byte for this to get from 0-255.  Ren-C uses that byte for the "flavor"
//   of the series (a unique name distinguishing series "type" vs. cell "type")
//   and then maps from flavor to size.

// of a manual use of the FREE operation.
//
// It would be costly if all series access operations had to check the

// the series is accessible at the time of extraction.  Subsequent access of

//
// !!! Is there checking in all paths?  Do series contractions check this?
//
// One important reason for ensuring a series is fixed size is to avoid
// the possibility of the data pointer being reallocated.  This allows
// code to ignore the usual rule that it is unsafe to hold a pointer to
// a value inside the series data...it still might have to check INACCESSIBLE.
//
// !!! Strictly speaking, SERIES_FLAG_NO_RELOCATE could be different
// from fixed size... if there would be a reason to reallocate besides
// changing size (such as memory compaction).  For now, just make the two
// equivalent but let the callsite distinguish the intent.

//
// But leaving it alone for the moment: there is a mechanical problem that the
// specific number of bytes requested for allocating series data is not saved.
// Only the series capacity measured in elements is known.
//
// Hence this flag is marked on the node, which is enough to recreate the
// actual number of allocator bytes to release when the series is freed.  The
// memory is accurately tracked for GC decisions, and balances back to 0 at

//
// The optimization which uses small series will fit the data into the series
// node if it is small enough.  This flag is set when a series uses its
// `content` for tracking information instead of the actual data itself.
//
// It can also be passed in at series creation time to force an allocation to
// be dynamic.  This is because some code is more interested in performance
// gained by being able to assume where to look for the data pointer and the
// length (e.g. paramlists and context varlists/keylists).  So passing this
// flag into series creation routines avoids creating the shortened form.
//
// Note: Currently SERIES_FLAG_INACCESSIBLE overrides this, but does not
// remove the flag...e.g. there can be inaccessible contexts that carry the
// SERIES_FLAG_ALWAYS_DYNAMIC bit but no longer have an allocation.
//
// Note: At one time the USED_BYTE() of 255 was the signal for this.  But
// being able to pass in the flag to creation routines easily, and make the
// test easier with Get_Series_Flag(), was seen as better.  Also, this means

//
// !!! Future plans involve being able to dynamically switch out the info
// bits for a node, e.g. to hold a lock.  Then the info bits would be moved
// to the lock--which might itself be a feed or frame (to avoid making a new

//
// SERIES NODE ("REBSER") STRUCTURE DEFINITION
//
//=////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// A REBSER node is normally the size of two REBVALs (though compiling with
// certain debug flags can add tracking information).  See %sys-rebnod.h for
// explanations of how obeying the header-in-first-slot convention allows a
// REBSER to be distinguished from a REBVAL or a UTF-8 string and not run
// afoul of strict aliasing requirements.
//
// There are 3 basic layouts which can be overlaid inside the union (the
// "leader" is the "header" with a different name to avoid uses which might
// alias with bits initialized through REBVAL->header):
//
//      Dynamic: [leader link [allocation tracking] info misc]
//     Singular: [leader link [REBVAL cell] info misc]
//      Pairing: [[REBVAL cell] [REBVAL cell]]
//
// The singular form has space the *size* of a cell, but can be addressed as
// raw bytes used for UTF-8 strings or other smallish data.  If a REBSER is
// aligned on a 64-bit boundary, the internal cell should be on a 64-bit
// boundary as well, even on a 32-bit platform where the header and link are
// each 32-bits.  See ALIGN_SIZE for notes on why this is important.
//
// `info` is not the start of a "Rebol Node" (REBNODE, e.g. either a REBSER or
// a REBVAL cell).  But in the singular case it is positioned right where
// the next cell after the embedded Cell(*) would* be.  To lower the risk of
// stepping into that location and thinking it is a cell, it has the bit for
// NODE_FLAG_CELL as clear.
//
// Singulars have widespread applications in the system.  One is that a
// "single element array living in a series node" makes a very efficient
// implementation of an API handle to a value.  Plus it's used notably in the
// efficient implementation of FRAME!.  They also narrow the gap in overhead
// between COMPOSE [A (B) C] vs. REDUCE ['A B 'C] such that the memory cost
// of the array is nearly the same as just having another value in the array.
//
// Pair REBSERs are allocated from the REBSER pool instead of their own to
// help exchange a common "currency" of allocation size more efficiently.
// They are used in the PAIR! datatype, but can have other interesting
// applications when exactly two values (with no termination) are needed.
//
// Most of the time, code does not need to be concerned about distinguishing
// Pair from the Dynamic and Singular layouts--because it already knows
// which kind it has.  Only the GC needs to be concerned when marking
// and sweeping.
