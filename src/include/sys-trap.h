// Rebol is settled upon a stable and pervasive implementation baseline of
// ANSI-C (C89).  That commitment provides certain advantages.
//
// One of the *disadvantages* is that there is no safe way to do non-local
// jumps with stack unwinding (as in C++).  If you've written some code that
// performs a raw malloc and then wants to "throw" via a `longjmp()`, that
// will leak the malloc.
//
// In order to mitigate the inherent failure of trying to emulate stack
// unwinding via longjmp, the macros in this file provide an abstraction
// layer.  These allow Rebol to clean up after itself for some kinds of
// "dangling" state--such as manually memory managed series that have been
// made with Make_Series() but never passed to either Free_Unmanaged_Series()
// or Manage_Series().  This covers several potential leaks known-to-Rebol,
// but custom interception code is needed for any generalized resource
// that might be leaked in the case of a longjmp().
//
// The triggering of the longjmp() is done via "fail", and it's important
// to know the distinction between a "fail" and a "throw".  In Rebol
// terminology, a `throw` is a cooperative concept, which does *not* use
// longjmp(), and instead must cleanly pipe the thrown value up through
// the OUT pointer that each function call writes into.  The `throw` will
// climb the stack until somewhere in the backtrace, one of the calls
// chooses to intercept the thrown value instead of pass it on.
//
// By contrast, a `fail` is non-local control that interrupts the stack,
// and can only be intercepted by points up the stack that have explicitly
// registered themselves interested.  So comparing these two bits of code:
//
//     catch [if 1 < 2 [trap [print ["Foo" (throw "Throwing")]]]]
//
//     trap [if 1 < 2 [catch [print ["Foo" (fail "Failing")]]]]
//
// In the first case, the THROW is offered to each point up the chain as
// a special sort of "return value" that only natives can examine.  The
// `print` will get a chance, the `trap` will get a chance, the `if` will
// get a chance...but only CATCH will take the opportunity.
//
// In the second case, the FAIL is implemented with longjmp().  So it
// doesn't make a return value...it never reaches the return.  It offers an
// ERROR! up the stack to native functions that have called PUSH_TRAP() in
// advance--as a way of registering interest in intercepting failures.  For
// IF or CATCH or PRINT to have an opportunity, they would need to be changed
// to include a PUSH_TRAP() call.
//
//=//// NOTES /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////=//
//
// * Mixing C++ and C code using longjmp is a recipe for disaster.  The plan
//   is that API primitives like rebRescue() will be able to abstract the
//   mechanism for fail, but for the moment only longjmp is implemented.

// R3-Alpha set up a separate `jmp_buf` at each point in the stack that wanted
// to be able to do a TRAP.  With stackless Ren-C, only one jmp_buf is needed
// per instance of the Trampoline on the stack.  (The codebase ideally does
// not invoke more than one trampoline to implement its native code, but if
// it is to call out to C code that wishes to use synchronous forms of API
// calls then nested trampolines may occur.)
//
// 1. We put the jmp_buf first, since it has alignment specifiers on Windows
//
// 2. When you run longjmp(), you can pass it a parameter which will be
//    the apparent result of the setjmp() when it gets teleported back to.
//    However, this parameter is only 32-bit even on 64-bit platforms, so it
//    is not enough to hold a pointer.  (C++'s `throw` can pass an arbitrary
//    value up to the `catch`, so this isn't needed in that case.)
//
// 3. Technically speaking, there's not a need for Fail_Core() to know what
//    the currently running level is before it jumps...because any cleanup
//    it wants to do, it can do after the jump.  However, there's benefit
//    that if there's any "bad" situation noticed to be able to intercept
//    it before the stack state has been lost due to throw()/longjmp()...
//    a debugger has more information on hand.  For this reason, the
//    trampoline stores its concept of "current" level in the jump structure
//    so it is available to Fail_Core() for automated or manual inspection.

// Note: longjmp is able to pass a value (though only an integer on 64-bit

// dictate the value setjmp returns in the longjmp case, though the code

// Because of this longjmp/setjmp "clobbering", it's a useful warning to

// TRAP_BLOCK is an abstraction of `try {} catch(...) {}` which can also
// work in plain C using setjmp/longjmp().  It's for trapping "abrupt errors",
// which are triggered the `fail` pseudo-"keyword" in C code.  These happen at
// arbitrary moments and are not willing (or able) to go through a normal
// `return` chain to pipe the error to the trampoline as a "thrown value".
//
// IN THE SETJMP IMPLEMENTATION...
//
// Jump buffers contain a pointer-to-a-Context(*) which represents an error.
// Using the tricky mechanisms of setjmp/longjmp, there will be a first pass
// of execution where setjmp() returns 0 and it will fall through to the
// code afterward.  When the longjmp() happens, the CPU will be teleported
// back to the setjmp(), where we have it return a 1...and goto the label
// for the `abrupt_failure`.
//
// On the line after the label, it takes the named variable you want to
// declare and assigns it the error pointer that had been assigned in the
// jump buffer.
//
// IN THE TRY/CATCH IMPLEMENTATION...
//
// With the setjmp() version of the macros, it's incidental that what follows
// the TRAP_BLOCK is a C scope {...}.  But it's critical to the TRY/CATCH
// version...because the last thing in the macro is a hanging `try` keyword.
// Similarly, what follows the ON_ABRUPT_FAILURE() need not be a scope in the
// setjmp() version, but must be a block for the hanging `catch(...)`.
//
// Because of that scope requirement, the only way to slip a named error
// variable into the subsequent scope is to actually make the error what the
// `throw` is passed.  Fortunately this works out exactly as one would want!
//

// 1. Although setjmp() does return a value, that value cannot be used in
//    conditions, e.g. `setjmp(...) ? x : y`
//
//    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30416403/
//
// 2. setjmp() can't be used with inline functions in gcc:
//
//    https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=24556
//
//    According to the developers, "This is not a bug as if you inline it,
//    the place setjmp goes to could be not where you want to goto."
//
// 3. Sadly, there's no real way to make the C version "automagically" know
//    when you've done a `return` out of the trapped block.  As a result, the
//    notion of which CPU buffer to jump to cannot be updated--which is a
//    requirement when nested instances of the trap are allowed.
//
//    We make the best of it by using it as an opportunity to keep other
//    information up to date, like letting the system globally know what
//    level the trampoline currently is running (which may not be TOP_LEVEL).
