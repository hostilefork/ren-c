# Needful: Verify C Code Using A C++ Compiler

This folder contains files that are intended to be factored out and released
as an independent MIT-licensed library called "Needful", with the goal of
helping people to use C++ compilers to verify properties of C codebases...
while still being able to compile that code with a C compiler.

Migration to a library with its own test suite and documentation is a work
in progress.
