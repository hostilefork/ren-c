    Description: {
        Rebol's PARSE is a tool for performing RegEx-style tasks using an
        English-like dialect.  It permits breaking down complex expressions
        into named subrules, and has a very freeform model for escaping into
        and back out of imperative code:

        http://www.rebol.com/docs/core23/rebolcore-15.html
        http://www.codeconscious.com/rebol/parse-tutorial.html
        https://www.red-lang.org/2013/11/041-introducing-parse.html

        The implementation of PARSE engines has traditionally been as
        optimized systems-level code (e.g. C or Red/System), built into the
        interpreter.  This does not offer flexibility to make any minor or
        major changes to the dialect that a user might imagine.

        This script attempts to make PARSE more "hackable", by factoring the
        implementation out so that each keyword or data behavior is handled
        by an individual `parser` function.  The parameters to this function
        are stylized so that the parse engine can compose these smaller
        parsers together as part of larger processing operations.  This
        approach is typically called "Parser Combinators":

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator

        While this overlaps with typical parser combinators, Rebol's design
        affords it a unique spin.  By building the backbone of the dialect as
        a BLOCK!, there's no SEQUENCE or ALTERNATIVE combinators.  Instead,
        blocks make sequencing implicit just by steps being ordered after one
        another.  The alternates are managed by means of `|` markers, which
        are detected by the implementation of the block combinator--and `|` is
        not a combinator in its own right.  With novel operators and convenient
        ways of switching into imperative processing, it gets a unique and
        literate feel with a relatively clean appearance.

        By making the combinator list passed to UPARSE as a MAP!, is possible
        to easily create overrides or variations of the dialect.  (For
        instance, a version that is compatible with older Rebols.)  But the
        goal is to facilitate even more ambitious features.
    }

    Notes: {
        * This implementation will be *extremely* slow for the foreseeable
          future.  But since it is built on usermode facilities, any
          optimizations that are applied to it will bring systemic benefits.
          Ultimately the goal is to merge this architecture in with the
          "messier" C code...hopefully preserving enough of the hackability
          while leveraging low-level optimizations where possible.

; All combinators receive the INPUT to be processed.  They are also given an
; object representing the STATE of the parse (currently that is just the
; FRAME! of the main UPARSE call which triggered the operation, so any of the
; locals or parameters to that can be accessed, e.g. the list of /COMBINATORS)
;
; The goal of a combinator is to decide whether to match (by returning a
; synthesized value and the updated position in the series) or fail to match
; (by returning an isotopic error)
;
; Additional parameters to a combinator are fulfilled by the parse engine by
; looking at the ensuing rules in the rule block.
;
; One of the parameter types that can be given to these functions are another
; parser, to combine them (hence "parser combinator").  So you can take a
; combinator like TRY and parameterize it with SOME which is parameterized
; with "A", to get a composite parser that implements `try some "a"`.
;
; But if a parameter to a combinator is marked as quoted, then that will take
; a value from the callsite literally.
;
; A special COMBINATOR generator is used.  This saves on repetition of
; parameters and also lets the engine get its hooks into the execution of
; parsers...for instance to diagnose the furthest point the parsing reached.

; !!! COMBINATOR is used so heavily that having it be usermode makes UPARSE
; prohibitively slow.  So it was made native.  However the usermode version is
; kept as a proof of concept that a user *could* have made such a thing.  It
; should be swapped in occasionally in the tests to overwrite the native
; version just to keep tabs on it.
;
; We would like it to be possible to write an "easy" combinator that does not
; do piping of the pending elements, but takes it for granted as coming from
; the success or failure of each parser called in order.  If you formally
; declare a return value for the `pending:` then that means you're going to
; manage it yourself, otherwise it will be automagic.

    ;
    ; RETURN was removed for a time in Ren-C due to concerns about how it

    ; complete.  Now UPARSE can return ANY-VALUE! and the only reason you'd

    === SUBPARSE COMBINATOR ===

    ; Rebol2 had a INTO combinator which only took one argument: a rule to use
    ; when processing the nested input.  There was a popular proposal that
    ; INTO would take a datatype, which would help simplify a common pattern.
    ;
    ;     ahead text! into [some "a"]  ; arity-1 form
    ;     =>
    ;     into text! [some "a"]  ; arity-2 form, from proposals/Topaz
    ;
    ; The belief being that wanting to test the type you were going "INTO" was
    ; needed more often than not, and that at worst it would incentivize adding
    ; the type as a comment.  Neither R3-Alpha nor Red adopted this proposal
    ; (but Topaz did).
    ;
    ; UPARSE reframes this not to take just a datatype, but a "value-bearing
    ; rule".  This means you can use it with generated data that is not
    ; strictly resident in the series, effectively parameterizing it like
    ; PARSE itself...so it's called SUBPARSE:
    ;
    ;     parse "((aaaa)))" [subparse [between some "(" some ")"] [some "a"]]
    ;
    ; Because any value-bearing rule can be used, GROUP! rules are also legal,
    ; which lets you break the rules up for legibility (and avoids interpreting
    ; arrays as rules themselves)
    ;
    ;     parse [| | any any any | | |] [
    ;          content: between some '| some '|
    ;          subparse (content) [some 'any]
    ;     ]

    === NEW-STYLE ANY COMBINATOR ===

    ; Historically ANY was a synonym for what is today TRY SOME FURTHER.  It
    ; was seen as a confusing usage of the word ANY given its typical meaning
    ; related to picking a single item from a list of alternatives--not a
    ; looping construct.
    ;
    ; The new meaning of ANY provides the ability to treat a BLOCK! received
    ; as an argument as a block of alternatives.  This can frequently be more
    ; convenient than trying to build a block of alternatives with `|`, as
    ; that has conditions on the edges where [| ...] is always a no-op as it
    ; means the same thing as [[] | ...], and [... |] will always succeed if
    ; the other alternatives fail because it is the same as [... | []].
    ;
    ; Due to not wanting to handle the block argument as a rule dispatched to
    ; the block combinator, syntax is `any (alternates)` not `any alternates`.

    === BLOCK! COMBINATOR ===

    ; Handling of BLOCK! is the central combinator.  The contents are processed
    ; as a set of alternatives separated by `|`, with a higher-level sequence
    ; operation indicated by `||`.  The bars are treated specially; e.g. | is
    ; not an "OR combinator" due to semantics, because if arguments to all the
    ; steps were captured in one giant ACTION! that would mean changes to
    ; variables by a GROUP! would not be percieved by later steps...since once
    ; a rule like SOME captures a variable it won't see changes:
    ;
    ; https://forum.rebol.info/t/when-should-parse-notice-changes/1528
    ;
    ; (There is also a performance benefit, since if | was a combinator then
    ; a sequence of 100 alternates would have to build a very large OR
    ; function...rather than being able to build a small function for each
    ; step that could short circuit before the others were needed.)

=== ENTRY POINTS: PARSE*, PARSE, MATCH-PARSE ===

; The historical Redbol PARSE was focused on returning a LOGIC! so that you
; could write `if parse data rules [...]` and easily react to finding out if
; the rules matched the input to completion.
;
; While this bias stuck with UPARSE in the beginning, the deeper power of
; returning the evaluated result made it hugely desirable as the main form
; that owns the word "PARSE".  A version that does not check to completion
; is fundamentally the most powerful, since it can just make HERE the last
; result...and then check that the result is at the tail.  Other variables
; can be set as well.
;
; So this formulates everything on top of a PARSE* that returns the sythesized
; result
