        The fledgling module system in R3-Alpha was never widely used or

; !!! R3-Alpha Module loading had the ability to be delayed.  This was so
; that special modules like CGI protocols or HTML formatters could be available
; in the SYSTEM.MODULES list...held as just headers and the BINARY! or BLOCK!
; that would be used to initialize them.  The feature obfuscated more
; foundational design points, so was temporarily removed...but should be
; brought back once the code solidifies.

; This function decodes the script header from the script body.  It checks the
; header 'compress and 'content options, and supports length-specified  or
; script-in-a-block embedding.
;
; It will set the 'content field to the binary source if 'content is true.
; The 'content will be set to the source at the position of the beginning of
; the script header, skipping anything before it. For multi-scripts it doesn't
; copy the portion of the content that relates to the current script, or at
; all, so be careful with the source data you get.
;
; If the 'compress option is set then the body will be decompressed.  Binary
; vs. script encoded compression will be autodetected.
;
; Normally, returns the header object, the body text (as binary), and the
; end of the script or script-in-a-block. The end position can be used to
; determine where to stop decoding the body text. After the end is the rest of
; the binary data, which can contain anything you like. This can support
; multiple scripts in the same binary data ("multi-scripts").
;
; If not /ONLY and the script is embedded in a block and not compressed then
; the body text will be a decoded block instead of binary, to avoid the
; overhead of decoding the body twice.
;
; Syntax errors are returned as words:
;    no-header
;    bad-header
;    bad-compress

    ; These arguments may include relative file paths like %foo.txt, where the

    ; who invoked DO.  The best way of letting the script stay in that view
    ; is to leave the current working directory where it is.
    ;
    ; But when you IMPORT a module, this module is imported once even if it is
    ; invoked from multiple locations.  Hence one should not rely on side
    ; effects of an IMPORT, nor be passing it arguments (as no code might run
    ; at all on the IMPORT).  So the only real sensible notion for a "current

    ; This routine is attempting to merge two distinct codebases: IMPORT
    ; and DO.  They have common needs for looking up <tag> shorthands to make
    ; URLs, or to cleanly preserve the directories, etc.  But the actual
    ; execution is different: modules are imported only once and the body
    ; result is discarded, while DO can run multiple times and the body result
    ; is returned as the overall return for the DO.
    ;
    ; !!! None of this is perfect...but it's much better than what had come
    ; from the unfinished R3-Alpha module system, and its decade of atrophy
    ; that happened after that...
