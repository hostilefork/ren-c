    purpose: --[
        While emitting text files isn't exactly rocket science, it can help
        to have a few sanity checks on the process.

        The features added here vs. writing lines oneself are:

        * Some awareness of C constructs and the automatic conversion of
          Rebol symbols to valid C identifiers, as well as a not-too-invasive
          method for omitting commas from the ends of enum or initializer
          lists (they're not legal in standard C or C++).

        * Not allowing whitespace at the end of lines, tab characters in the
          output, some abilities to manage indentation.

        * Automatically generating C comment headers or Rebol headers, and
          including "DO NOT EDIT" warnings on temporary files.

        * Being able to use the information of the file and title being
          generated to provide notifications of what work is currently in
          progress to make errors easier to locate.

; 1. If you say $<content > then if the contents don't vanish, a space will be
;    included at the end.  But if it vanishes, there will be no space either.
;
; 2. If you say $<block,> then it will delimit the block with comma.  And if
;    block is empty then it will vanish (potentially vanishing the line).
;
; 3. These can be combined, so that $<xxx, > will delimit with ", "
