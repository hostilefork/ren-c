    Version: 0.2.0

    Description: {
        Continuous integration builds of Windows, Mac, and Linux executables of
        Ren-C are placed on S3 storage.  This is done despite the fact that
        these builds are made to exercise build configurations.  Hence they are
        NOT "packaged" for any particular customer or usage.

        Some have decided to use these builds anyway.  :-/

        We generate a URL of the latest "greenlit" binary on S3 for a given
        platform.  In order to be greenlit a binary is only tested for very
        basic operation; starting up and shutting down successfully, and being
        able to do a successful HTTPS read.  Further testing is the
        responsibility of the committers at this time.
    }
    Usage: {
        ; Currently this is not implemented as a module; but script isolation
        ; means the only way you can get a function out is as a return result
        ; of the script.  We are reviewing the packaging options as the module
        ; system matures.

        >> latest-of: do <latest-of>

        ; An invocation with no arguments (or a blank argument) will assume you
        ; want the latest version of the currently running interpreter.

        >> latest-of
        == http://...

        ; Invocation with an OS_ID tuple only will get you the latest *debug*
        ; version of for that OS_ID (if it's in the CI builds).  Platform list:
        ;
        ;   https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/tools/platforms.r
        ;
        ; All stakeholders should run debug builds by default, unless you have
        ; a good reason not to!  Bug reports will not be processed unless the
        ; test has been reproduced under an instrumented build.

        >> latest-of 0.4.40  ; e.g. 64-bit-linux
        == http://...-debug....

        ; If you use /VARIANT you can ask for another variation, e.g. release
        ; should you have a *really* good reason.  (Please don't!  Help test!)

        >> latest-of/variant 0.3.1 'release  ; e.g. 32-bit Windows
        == http://...

        ; If you don't want the "latest" but just the build for a known commit,
        ; you can do this by using its short hash.

        >> latest-of/commit 0.4.40 "9d15d31"
        == http://...r3-9d15d31-...
    }
    Notes: {
      * This is intended to work in the Web REPL as well as the desktop builds,
        as both currently support READ and INFO? for URLs.  Note that only
        servers that enable "CORS" for a URL can be read by browsers.  (The
        S3 configuration we have for the builds has this enabled.)

      * Builds vary wildly by platform, 32-bit or 64-bit, hard float or soft
        float, emscripten binaryen/asyncify/pthreads...not to mention infinite
        combinations of extensions.  As already mentioned, the CI builds are
        done in a spread to serve the development process itself, not any
        particular use case.

        So right now the only choice you have is debug or release.  Depending
        on platform that may get you some features and not others.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        Learn to read workflows and get involved if you have strong feelings!

          https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/tree/master/.github/workflows

        (There shouldn't be users of Ren-C yet, only *participating designers*,
        who all know how to build it and patch it.  So please avoid pushing
        expectations just because this script is allowed to exist. --HF)

      * In order to make sure this script stays working, it is tested by the
        greenlighting process itself.  Once a build is greenlit it makes sure
        the script will run and return the URL it just uploaded.  But note that
        this is subject to bootstrap problems...your interpreter may become out
        of date so it cannot run the current incarnation of %latest-of.reb - if
        you hit that, run LATEST-OF in the Web Repl instead of a desktop build.

warning: {
    !!! IMPORTANT WARNING !!!

    Ren-C is an experimental project whose primary focus is on the WebAssembly
    target.  Desktop and native binaries are still built as part of continuous
    integration, but these are permutations designed to exercise many different
    build settings--and are not packaged or optimized to satisfy any particular
    usage scenario.  They are likely to be too big/slow (due to having debug
    instrumentation) or incomplete (due to being built under constraints), and
    every random Internet executable is going to tangle with virus checkers.

    Making these builds available for download is done despite *strong* protest
    from the project leadership.  Stakeholders should be building the sources
    themselves and picking the set of extensions and optimizations that make
    sense for them.  Using these binaries instead is completely unsupported,
    and any complaints about them (size, speed, included features) will get
    you pointed to the sources to do your own builds.
