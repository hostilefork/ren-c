    Description: --{
        Emscripten is the name for a tool suite that makes it easier to build
        C/C++ programs that will run in JavaScript/WebAssembly environments.

        The LLVM Toolchain itself covers generating Wasm code from C or C++.
        So where Emscripten fits in is to provide shims that code written to
        call library functions to "just work" in the browser.  This applies
        to high level graphics APIs down to low level functions like malloc()
        and free(), which have no standard implementation in Wasm.

        Also notable is the support for embedding JavaScript code inline
        into C code, via the EM_ASM and EM_JS instructions.  This is used to
        implement the "JavaScript extension", which adds the JS-NATIVE and
        JS-EVAL functions to the Ren-C runtime in order to make it possible
        to smoothly integrate JavaScript and Ren-C.
    }--

      * EMCC Command-Line Options List
        https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html

      * Variables present when JS Compiler runs, set with `-sOPTION1=VALUE1`
        https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/src/settings.js

      * EMCC_DEBUG is an environment variable for diagnostic output

      * It's possible to use Emscripten to build Wasm code for a runtime that
        does not have any JavaScript.  This is the STANDALONE_WEBASSEMBLY
        option, but it lacks several features that are accomplished better
        using a different compiler than emcc; instead use clang with the
        wasi-sdk.  See %configs/wasi.r for that configuration.

      * There is special binding glue which implements the libRebol API in
        Emscripten, so that functions like reb.Value(...) are available to
        JavaScript in the build.  See %prep-libr3-js.reb for that somewhat
        intricate glue.

; When browsers run code, it's required that you yield control and return
; from all your stack levels to perform certain operations (like GUI updates
; or network IO).  Ren-C is now "stackless" and can accomplish this without
; special measures:
;
; https://forum.rebol.info/t/stackless-is-here-today-now/1844
;
; But previously it has used Emsterpreter, Pthreads, and Asyncify to work
; around those problems.  The build settings are kept in case there are some
; integration scenarios that may require these methods again:

; Ren-C has build options for supporting C++ exceptions or the use of setjmp()
; and longjmp() (or just to panic, and not handle them at all).  This affects
; how "abrupt" failures that arise in native code is treated--e.g. the calls
; to the `fail()` "pseudo-keyword".
;
; WebAssembly does not have native support for setjmp() and longjmp(), but
; Emscripten offers some hacks that implement it.  There is a webassembly
; standard for exceptions that is emerging as a better replacement.
;
; So by default we use the `try {...} catch {...}` variant of the exception
; implementation, to exercise it in the web build.

; comes at a cost of not inlining, which winds up meaning more than just
; slower in the browser: the intrinsic limit of how many JS/WASM functions it
; lets be on the stack is hit sooner.  We can do per-file optimization choices
; so the #prefer-O2-optimization flag is set on the %c-eval.c file, which
